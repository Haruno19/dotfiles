<h2> Description & Details</h2>  
<p> 
  <b>Minimal Green</b> is, as hinted by its name, a setup made with minimalism in mind.
  <br><br>
  Seeking an interesting, but not complex, contrast between the UI elements and the wallpaper, I chose a bright and simple, but not dull, background image accompanied by dark and plain UI elements.
  <br><br>
  Visual Studio Code too has been revised to achieve a more simple and plain layout.
