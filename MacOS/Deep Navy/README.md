<h2> Description & Details</h2>  
<p> 
  <b>Deep Navy</b> is an elegant-looking setup.
  <br><br>
  My challange with this one was not to use any greyscale color, or even black and white, and create an overall elegant and pleasant-looking setup. 
  <br><br>
  The problem with solarized color schemes is that, in my opinion, they generally tend to look too extravagant and, overall, eventually, "inconsistent".
  <br><br>
  That's why for <b>Deep Navy</b> I chose a set of pale and dull colors, soft to the eye but still contrasting enough to make a good color scheme.
