<h2> Description & Details</h2>  
<h6><i>Created on 23 October 2023</i></h6><br>
<p> 
  <b>Raindrop</b> is my first setup to use SketchyBar instead of the default MacOS Menu Bar.
  <br><br>
  My goal was to create a setup that felt <i>personal</i> but at the same time, that would also look and feel as premium as the first-party option.
