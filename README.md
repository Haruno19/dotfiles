<h2 align="center">My Current Setup</h2>

<h3 align="left">MacBook Pro 14"</h3>

    My current daily-driver is a <b>14inch M1 Pro MacBook Pro</b>.
    <br><br>
    To keep its look in line with the <b>minimalistic</b> style I like, I'm using a <b>black and white</b> color palette,
    which also grants an overall elegant look to the system, perfect formal enviroments like university.
    <br><br>
    <b>Productivity</b> is also a key aspect of this setup, and I think it blends well with the concept of minimalism.
    Automatic hiding for the <b>Dock</b> is perfect for focusing; it reduces the number of elements on screen and gives more screen space to apps and programs.
    <br><br>
    In addition to <b>MacOS</b>'s very efficient workflow, I use <b>Rectangle</b> to arrange the windows with shortcuts and snap areas.

<h3 align="left">Xiaomi Mi 9</h3>
  <p align="left">
    My daily-driver smartphone is currently a <b>Xiaomi Mi 9</b>.
    <br>
    I've always been an iPhone user, but the last time I had to upgrade my phone, I wanted to try a different experience and ended up buying 
    my first <b>Android</b> smartphone, form Xiaomi.
    <br><br>
    After some years using it, I can confidently say my next phone will be an iPhone again, but for now I want
    to <b>get the most out</b> of my current device. <b>MIUI</b> isn't the best Android ROM out there in terms of customization, but I think I still
    managed to make a setup I feel <b>comfortable</b> using.
    <br><br>
    <b>Consistency</b> is the key to achieve a good-looking system, so I'm using the same wallpaper as my MacBook and a similar color scheme.
    <br><br>
    I don't like having <b>icons</b> on my homescreen, so I just keep the apps I use the most in the <i>Favourites</i> (at the bottom of the screen)
    and use the remaining screen space for <b>widgets</b>.
    <br>
    <br>&emsp;• "<b>Another Widget</b>" is my favourite date and meteo widget, <b>Alata</b> font looks compact and clear,
    and the overall look feels really polished. 
    <br>&emsp;• "<b>To-Do List</b>" is a great app to track habits and events, its widget has a clean and simple look too.
    <br>&emsp;• "<b>Digital Wellbeing</b>" helps me keep track of my daily smartphone usage.
    <br>&emsp;• "<b>Google Drive</b>" is essential to share files and media between devices on different systems.

    I have yet to upload dotfiles for my current setup, beacuse it's still evolving every day and I think it's not ready
    to be shared just yet.
    <br><br>
    But I will, <i>someday</i>.
    <br><br>
    I hope this page and my repository were somewhat interesting and inspiring for you, thank you for visiting!
