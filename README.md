<h2 align="center">My Current Setup</h2>

<h3 align="left">MacBook Pro 14"</h3>

    My current daily-driver is a <b>14inch M1 Pro MacBook Pro</b>.
    <br><br>
    Moving forward from the very <b>minimalistic</b> style of my previous setup, I'm maintaininf the <b>black and white</b> color palette but his time with a new, more lively wallpaper background. I still believe this color choide grants an overall elegant look to the system, which is perfect formal enviroments like university.
    <br><br>
    Hight <b>productivity</b> is still a key aspect of my workflow. The way I use my Mac hasn't changed much since last time, I keep Automatic hiding for the <b>Dock</b> on, which is perfect for focusing since it reduces the number of elements on screen and gives more screen space to the apps.
    <br><br>
    <b>Rectangle</b> is still my go-to window manager software.<br>
    I now use <b>Warp</b> Terminal instead of iTerm2, which has helped me improve my efficency while using command line tools.

<h3 align="left">Nothing Phone (1)</h3>
  <p align="left">
    My daily-driver smartphone is currently a <b>Nothing Phone (1)</b>.
    <br>
    Coming from my first Android experience with Xiaomi, for my new every-day pal I choosed something much more minimal by design.<br>
    My old Mi 9 was filled with bloatwere and proprietary-oriented choices I ultimately ended up not liking at all. 
    <br><br>
    <b>NothingOS</b> is almost a stock-Android experience, without any kind of bloat whatsoever. Just simple Android spiced up with a few of very cool (and minimal) design choices. <br> Maitaining one again the black&white color palette, I'm now using the <b>Dove</b> Icon Pack to achieve a more consistent and modern look.
    <br><br>
    Lately I've been using Digital Wellbeing apps timer and focus mode to help me reduce the useless time I waste on my phone, and that is part of the reason I felt like needing a change of scenery. 
    <br><br>
    I keep my home screen and app choice very simple and almost stock in order for my workflow to be as simple and fast as possible.

    I have yet to upload dotfiles for my current setup, beacuse it's still evolving every day and I think it's not ready
    to be shared just yet.
    <br><br>
    But I will, <i>someday</i>.
